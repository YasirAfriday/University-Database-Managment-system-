IMSciences Student Database Management System
Introduction
This project is a Database Management System (DBMS) developed for IMSciences to efficiently manage student records, departments, instructors, and courses. The system streamlines data storage, ensures consistency, and facilitates query execution.

Features
Entity-Relationship Model for structuring data relationships.
Relational Schema Construction using Top-Down and Bottom-Up approaches.
Normalization up to the 3rd Normal Form (3NF) for optimized storage.
SQL Queries for common operations (e.g., retrieving student data, department info, instructor assignments).
Views for quick data access.
Stored Procedures for automating student enrollment, grading, and reporting.
Functions to compute averages, count students, and fetch data efficiently.
Triggers for enforcing constraints (e.g., course enrollment limits, prerequisite completion checks).
